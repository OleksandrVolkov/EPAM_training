A JVM language is any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid class file which can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine.
A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (Java byte code) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information.
The class file format is the hardware- and operating system-independent binary format used to represent compiled classes and interfaces.
There are several JVM languages, both old languages ported to JVM and completely new languages. JRuby and Jython are perhaps the most well-known ports of existing languages, i.e. Ruby and Python respectively.
Of the new languages that have been created from scratch to compile to Java bytecode, Clojure, Apache Groovy, Scala and Kotlin may be the most popular ones.
A notable feature with the JVM languages is that they are compatible with each other, so that, for example, Scala libraries can be used with Java programs and vice versa.
